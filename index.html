			<p>I've decided to use a <b>HashMap</b> data structure to map out the word frequency as it offered the ability to use unique keys for the word, which maps over to an integer value that is the word count.</p>

			<p>I would like to continue to improve upon this project by using a LinkedHashMap to keep the stored
			data in connected memory locations which would make it easier to sort.</p>

			<p>I chose this song to analyze because a lot of punk rock songs from the 1970s, 80s and even 90s tended to have a very repetative easy to follow along lyric structure. Ramones are very well known for this song in particular and it was no suprise to me which words were the most used.</p>
